This project contains SQL queries that demonstrate various types of joins used in relational databases. The purpose of this project is to provide examples of how to effectively use joins to retrieve data from multiple tables.

## Overview

Joins are a fundamental aspect of SQL that allow you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. This project includes examples of the following types of joins:

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table records. It returns NULL for non-matching rows from both tables.

## Usage

To use the SQL queries in this project, open the `joins_queries.sql` file and execute the desired queries in your SQL environment. Make sure to have the necessary tables and data set up in your database to see the results of the joins.

Feel free to modify the queries to suit your specific database schema and requirements.
