# ALX Airbnb Database Advanced Script

## About the Project

This project is part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module. It focuses on advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques using a simulated Airbnb database. You will tackle real-world challenges such as optimizing query performance, writing complex SQL scripts, and applying indexing and partitioning. The goal is to equip you with hands-on experience in database management and performance tuning for large-scale, efficient, and scalable applications.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- **Master Advanced SQL:** Write complex queries with joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
- **Optimize Query Performance:** Use tools like `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` to analyze and refactor SQL scripts.
- **Implement Indexing and Partitioning:** Apply indexing and table partitioning to enhance performance on large datasets.
- **Monitor and Refine Performance:** Continuously monitor database health and refine schemas and queries.
- **Think Like a DBA:** Make data-driven decisions about schema design and optimization strategies.

## Requirements

To succeed in this project, you should:

- Understand SQL fundamentals (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`).
- Be familiar with relational database concepts (primary keys, foreign keys, normalization).
- Know basic performance monitoring tools (`EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`).
- Be able to manage a GitHub repository for submissions.

## Key Highlights

1. **Defining Relationships with ER Diagrams:** Model relationships between users, bookings, properties, and reviews.
2. **Complex Queries with Joins:** Use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` to extract insights.
3. **Power of Subqueries:** Write correlated and non-correlated subqueries for advanced analysis.
4. **Aggregations and Window Functions:** Use aggregation and window functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`).
5. **Indexing for Optimization:** Identify bottlenecks and create indexes to improve query speed.
6. **Query Optimization Techniques:** Refactor queries to reduce redundancies and leverage indexing.
7. **Partitioning Large Tables:** Implement table partitioning (e.g., on the Booking table) for better performance.
8. **Performance Monitoring and Schema Refinement:** Use `SHOW PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to monitor and refine performance.
